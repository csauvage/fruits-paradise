I've made this sample demo to illustrate my Medium article on how to use Apple Pay on the web. 

As I spent couple of yours facing issue in adding domains, verifying `.well-known`... I wrote this paper to help my fellow engineers to test Stripe's Apple Pay web integration. 

Enjoy and... remember : An 🍎 a day keeps the 👩🏻‍⚕️away !

## How to use

Clone or fork this repo, set your own Stripe-Key in `src/App/App.js`


```js

const stripeKey = 'pk_test_XXX';

```

and run `yarn start` or `npm start`
